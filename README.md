**SmartCal** is an intelligent scheduling assistant built as a single, self-contained HTML file that leverages a multi-agent architecture to automate and optimize calendar management without requiring any installation, frameworks, or backend infrastructure. The system deploys four specialized agents working in parallel — the Availability Agent continuously monitors the calendar for scheduling conflicts and automatically inserts 15-minute recovery buffers after any meeting exceeding 60 minutes, ensuring cognitive breathing room between back-to-back sessions; the Preference Learner analyzes meeting patterns across the schedule, identifies the 9–11am window as the peak productivity slot, and tags recurring meetings for consistency optimization across daily, weekly, and monthly cycles; the Optimization Agent applies a multi-factor risk scoring model to flag meetings with elevated cancellation probability, specifically targeting external meetings with large participant counts and extended durations; and the Negotiation Protocol handles multi-party scheduling coordination for groups of 20 or more people, displaying real-time consensus progress and availability polling across time zones. On top of the agent layer, the system delivers four core deliverables in a live dashboard — a Calendar Optimizer that renders a sorted, color-coded meeting list enriched with smart tags, a Meeting Analytics panel tracking totals, hours scheduled, conflict counts, and category breakdowns, a Smart Suggestions engine that generates context-aware recommendations dynamically as meetings are added, and a Time-Savings Calculator that quantifies hours recovered versus manual scheduling using a weighted scoring model across conflict resolution, buffer insertion, travel block management, and cancellation prediction. The ScaleDown compression layer simulates 80% history compression across a 12-month calendar, reducing scheduling overhead by 75% and enabling coordination across 20-plus person meetings — all rendered in real time through a clean, responsive two-column grid interface built entirely in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
